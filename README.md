# GitCopyMaster

An executable to be used with FishingWithGit.
As a handler for commits, merges, and checkouts, it copies some of the repo files to another dir if certain conditions are met.

*Future Feature ideas:
>Allow GitCopyMaster to copy excluded files if they don't already exist in destDir
>Prevent GitCopyMaster from copying an empty repo
